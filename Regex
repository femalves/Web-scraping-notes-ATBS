Emails________________________________________________________________________


The first part of an email can contain any uppercase letter (A-Z), lowercase
letter (a-z) or number (0-9), as well as periods, underscores and plus signs.
By putting all these possible sequences and symbols in brackets (as opposed to
parentheses) we are saying "this symbol can be any one of these things we've
listed in the brackets." The final plus sign means "these characters can occur
as many times as they want to, but must occur at least once".

@
Must have the @ symbol

[A-Za-z]+
Must contain at least one uppercase or lowercase letter after the @.

\.
This is followed by a "."

(com\org\edu\net)
Finally, the email address ends with com, org, edu or net.

By concatenating all of the rules, we have the following regular expression.
[A-Za-z0-9\._+]+@[A-Za-z]+\.(com\org\edu\net)
